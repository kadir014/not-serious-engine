# not-serious-engine
Toy retro 3D engine and game.

The inspiration for this project is the Serious Sam and Half Life franchises (mainly the first games, hence the retro theme).

Concisely, I just want a barebones 3D arcade shooter engine with hordes of enemies, lots of cool weapons, arena maps and of course a retro feel & look.
